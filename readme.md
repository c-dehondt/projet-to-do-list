## context of the project ##
We are software developer for the company Software & Telecom, a customer,Mr. MOREAU, has ordered you a software of which you are in charge of the realization.

Mr. MOREAU runs a building construction company, as part of this activity, his construction managers are led to manage several projects / worksites which require a lot of organization if they wish to achieve all the necessary tasks on the site .

Until now, its teams use large tables (one per project) on which they paste post-it and write the deadlines for the realization of the various tasks. However, this system takes time, space and is not very secure (a passing person can easily remove a project or task). That's why Mr. MOREAU has commissioned a software solution that will allow you to do exactly the same job but on a computer.

Mr. MOREAU is aware that the deadlines are short and that you are still a young developer , if you wish to be paid, it will be necessary to deliver an application which allows at least:

- Create project
- Display projects created on a home page
- Create sub-steps for projects
- Display the sub-steps created for each project when you click on the project (the user arrives on a project-specific page )
- Add tasks to complete sub-steps
- Display tasks created
- Delete as desired each project / sub-step / task
- Mark each project / substep / task as finished (with a color code or other, the customer leaves you the choice)

On the other hand, Mr. MOREAU has additional expectations, but you do not have to answer them, but if you want to have your end-of-year bonus, you will need to add the following features:
- A user management system (name, first name, age, e-mail address, password)
- A category management system (a certain number of users) number of categories are predefined and each project belongs to a specific category, the user can sort the projects according to their category)
- Projects classified by order of urgency according to their deadline
- Possibility of visiting the recycle bin to see projects deleted of the main table

## Technical specifications: ##
This application will allow us to evaluate all the skills of the professional title. Below you will find the benchmarked competencies and, if necessary, additional information on what you need to do to validate them.

#### Maquetter an application ####
Production of preparatory diagrams which present the main pages of the application in a way consistent with the final rendering, this on different supports (mobile wireframes, tablets, PCs that resemble the result on the screen) represents the use cases of the application in order to determine precisely how the application should behave (UseCase)

#### Design a database ####
Create a database schema where each of your tables will be represented with their different fields and the type of data stored.
